# Broken Access Control
Broken access control allows attackers to bypass authorisation, allowing them to view data they arent supposed to see, or perform tasks they aren't supposed to perform, for example:

- Perform admin-level actions
- Access other users' data
- Bypass security mechanisms

This broad category has been broken down into several sub-categories with insecure/secure versions 

1. [Missing Function Level Access Control](./missing-function-level-access-control/README.md) 
2. [Insecure Direct Object Reference](./insecure-direct-object-reference) 
3. [Weak Account Management](./weak-account-management)
