# AppSec Labs

This repository contains hands-on labs demonstrating common application security vulnerabilities, their exploitation, and secure remediation. Labs are organized by OWASP Top 10 categories and additional custom scenarios.

## Structure

Each folder typically includes:

- `insecure/`: vulnerable version of the app
- `secure/`: remediated version
- `README.md`: Explanation of the vulnerability, how it works, and how it's fixed
